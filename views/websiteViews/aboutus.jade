	.whitebox
		p We believe all organizations need to be financially sustainable in order to scale up their impact, and we're big believers that social enterprises are the way to building a society where everyone profits. We want to foster and support organizations that are changing the business landscape – organizations that think like smart and savvy businesses in order to grow the bottom line: their social impact.
		br
		p So whether you are looking to start an organization, support one, or work for one – whatever it may be, consider choosing a social enterprise – because when you choose social, everyone wins.
